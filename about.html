            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <hr />

            <p>
                At FinLit, we seek to teach new investors how to trade stocks and stock
                options through experience. Every investor made mistakes before,
                especially when they were starting out. They might have held onto a
                stock too long or sold it too early. Some may have missed out on
                opportunities because they didnâ€™t know how the market would respond
                to a news. Finlit aims to give people the opportunity to experience
                trading stocks at different times, whether it may be during a recession
                or an economic boom.
                <br />

                <br />
                Finlit will take a form of a game where the player is put into the past.
                The player is shown a list of real companies with their names changed,
                the stock chart of those companies at that time, and the news related
                to those companies. Players choose how much money they start out with
                and act as investors. They will research the data given to them to buy
                their desired stocks and options. At the end of the month, the game
                will end and players can see their trades and reflect on their decisions.
